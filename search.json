    "text": "Bowen de Gouw’s Website\n\n\n\n\nKia Ora, Thank you for visting my website!\nKia ora and welcome! I’m Bowen — a lifelong learner, student-athlete, and data-driven problem solver. I was born in the Netherlands, raised in New Zealand, and for now call Boston home. My journey across continents has shaped how I think, lead, and connect with others.\nGrowing up on Auckland’s North Shore, I learned to balance curiosity and discipline — two traits that came from equal parts academics and athletics. At Westlake Boys High School, one of New Zealand’s top-performing schools, I discovered my passion for both numbers and teamwork.\nIn my final year of high school, I earned an athletic scholarship to Boston University, joining the Men’s Rowing Team. At 18, I packed my bags and crossed the world, driven by the goal of earning a world-class education and competing at the highest collegiate level.\nFour years later — countless early mornings, races, and study sessions later — I graduated from the Questrom School of Business with a BSBA and a deep appreciation for resilience, leadership, and collaboration.\nAfter graduation, I wanted to sharpen my technical toolkit and bridge the gap between business insight and data analytics. That led me to pursue a Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics (MET, Boston University) — a program designed to explore predictive modeling, data mining, cloud platforms, and machine learning.\nMy goal is to use these tools to make data more human — helping organizations uncover insights that improve performance, experience, and impact.\n\n\n\nGet to know me!\n\nI am a huge sports fan and since moving to the US my passion for live sports events has flourished. I’ve been fortunate to watch MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL and CFB games live.\n\n\n\n🏆 My Favorite Teams\n\n\n\n\nRugby: All Blacks 🇳🇿\n\n\nSuper Rugby: Blues 💙\n\n\nNFL: New England Patriots 🏈\n\n\nNHL: Boston Bruins 🏒\n\n\nNBA: Boston Celtics 🏀\n\n\nCFB: Texas Longhorns 🤘\n\n\nMLB: Boston Red Sox ⚾️\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating my Graduation from Boston University’s DeWolfe Boathouse, May 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for the Inter-Collegiate Rowing Association (IRA) National Championships, May 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n LinkedIn · GitHub · Email"
