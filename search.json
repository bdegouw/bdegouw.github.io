    "text": "Kia Ora, Thank you for visting my website!\nI was originally born in the Netherlands, but grew up in Auckland, New Zealand. I attended one of New Zealand’s most successful boys-only high schools, where my passions for both academics and athletics flourished.\nIn my final year at Westlake Boys High School, I was rewarded with an Athlethic Scholarship to Boston University as Member of the Men’s Rowing Team. At the age of 18, I packed my bags chasing the goal of receiving a high-quality education and competing at the highest collegiate level.\nAfter 4 rigorous and demanding years as a Student-Athlete and Team Captain, I graduated from Boston University’s Questrom School of Business in May 2025\nPost-graduation, I wanted to develop a more technical analytical skillset, so I began working towards my Masters of Science in Applied Business Analytics in the Summer of 2025. I currently have an expected Graduation of May 2026.\nAs a STEM-designated course, my focus will be on applying my undergraduate Business background on real-world tools and methods, including predictive modeling, data mining, cloud platforms, machine learning and generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating my Graduation from Boston University’s DeWolfe Boathouse, May 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for the Inter-Collegiate Rowing Association (IRA) National Championships, May 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nBased in Boston, MA\nLinkedIn - Github - Email"
