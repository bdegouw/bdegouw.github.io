# Kia Ora, Thank you for visting my website!

Kia ora and welcome! I’m Bowen — a lifelong learner, student-athlete, and data-driven problem solver. I was born in the Netherlands, raised in New Zealand, and for now call Boston home. My journey across continents has shaped how I think, lead, and connect with others.

Growing up on Auckland's North Shore, I learned to balance curiosity and discipline — two traits that came from equal parts academics and athletics. At Westlake Boys High School, one of New Zealand’s top-performing schools, I discovered my passion for both numbers and teamwork.

In my final year of high school, I earned an athletic scholarship to Boston University, joining the Men’s Rowing Team. At 18, I packed my bags and crossed the world, driven by the goal of earning a world-class education and competing at the highest collegiate level.

Four years later — countless early mornings, races, and study sessions later — I graduated from the Questrom School of Business with a BSBA and a deep appreciation for resilience, leadership, and collaboration.

After graduation, I wanted to sharpen my technical toolkit and bridge the gap between business insight and data analytics. That led me to pursue a Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics (MET, Boston University) — a program designed to explore predictive modeling, data mining, cloud platforms, and machine learning.

My goal is to use these tools to make data more human — helping organizations uncover insights that improve performance, experience, and impact.
