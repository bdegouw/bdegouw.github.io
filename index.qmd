# Kia Ora! I am Bowen de Gouw 

I was originally born in the Netherlands, but grew up in Auckland, New Zealand. At the age of 18 I moved to Boston, MA to take up an Athlethic Scholarship at Boston University, where I was a four year member and team captain of the Men's Rowing Team.



I am currently a masters student at Boston University, studying Applied Business Analytics. My focus is on statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud based tools. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at Boston University's Questrom School of Business where I gained a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.
