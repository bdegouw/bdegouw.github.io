# Hello, World!  

Bowen de Gouw's Portfolio Website

This is repository is designed to demonstrate my learnings from AD688. Thank you for taking the time to look at my work.

Below is an example of a python script

```{python}
x = 3
y = 7
x + y


print("this shows that python is working!")

print("WEBSITE IS WORKING!")
```
