# Hello, Welcome to my Website!   

Bowen de Gouw's Portfolio Website

This is repository is designed to demonstrate my learnings from AD688. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my work.

Below is an example of a python script

```{python}
x = 3
y = 7
print('the answer for the equation will be printed beneath this message')
print(x + y)


print('this is an example of me using the website editing function through an EC2')
```
